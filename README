# Human Computer Interaction - Coursework 2

## Dependency Decisions

* Roboto
    * It's a good, well-recognized font.
* Font Awesome
    * Font Awesome has many well recognized icons such as search and chevrons
* jQuery
    * Convenience mostly, not for design
* Google Maps (as opposed to another map api)
    * Google Maps is well-recognized and easy to work with
* Typography
    * Following Google's material design styles for size, leading, etc.

## Design Decisions

* Page Layout
    * Map as big as possible for ease of use
    * Side panel is similar to original Google Maps side panel
    * Shortcut buttons look very distinctive, very obvious they are buttons
    * Content is grouped for ease of use
* Search Bar
    * Material design "floating paper" is very common in Google ecosystem, again well-recognized
    * Magnifying glass is standard search symbol
* Sections
    * Collapsible/expandable to make layout a bit cleaner
    * Chevrons are standard symbol
    * Very similar to Wikipedia sections on mobile, again well-recognized
* Buttons
    * Credit to http://tympanus.net/Development/CreativeButtons/
    * Original was red, restyled to green here because of positive connotations
    * Makes it very obvious they are action buttons
