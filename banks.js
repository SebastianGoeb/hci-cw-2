    content: '<p>Banks in Edinburgh have experience providing accounts to students from all over the world, so opening an account will not be a problem. Simply meet with one of the bank representatives in a local branch and ask to set up an account.\
    </p>\
    <h3>What do I need to bring?</h3><p>To open an account you will have to bring identification, proof of study, proof of address, and Visa (if applicable). The safest form of identification will be a passport but EU-identification cards and UK drivers licences are also accepted. A bill containing your address and name is acceptable proof of address. Some banks also accept a bank introduction letter from the university. Proof of study is some proof of your unconditional acceptance to your course. This is either a bank introduction letter from the university or your UCAS acceptance letter. The exact documents accepted by each bank will vary but will be available on their webpage, so check before you visit.</p>\
    <h3>Bank introduction letter</h3><p>The University have created a bank introduction letter that can be used at all banks listed below except for NatWest. This letter is sufficient to tell the bank that you are accepted to the course and what your term time address is. It can be found on the University provided service "Euclid". A simple way to find the service is by visiting myed.ed.ac.uk, you should have been provided with an account. Mouse over the "Accounts" tab and click on "EUCLID". In Euclid hit "Documents". The bank introduction letter can be found on this page.</p>\
    <p>Below follows a list of major banks. Each will have a slightly different student account with different benifits. Click on the buttons to find the bank\'s location and find links to further details. </p>',
